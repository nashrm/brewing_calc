Another thing I gotta get sorted out is our yield stuff...

Essentially, the abstract_doc file is outlining how to sparge the mash

Now I want to identify my fairly consistent yield with remedial
sparging methods... so in other words, we are homebrewers doing 5
gallon batches, we want an acceptable yield, but we are happy to do a
little more grain for a little less brewing effort.
